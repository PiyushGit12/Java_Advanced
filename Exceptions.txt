 *What is Exceptions in Java?

          An Event,Which occurs during the execution of a program, that disrupts the normal flow of the programs instructions.

 *** Exceptions Categories *******

    1-Checked Exceptions :- These are Exceptions which are caught by the Java compiler and need to be handle by Developer.Need
                           to be specified or handled with a Try-Catch block.
    2-UnChecked Exceptions :-These are not pointed out by the compiler but a good dev. should anticipate and handle them or
                identify them during the development and testing phases of a program.
   3- Errors :- These represents very serious problems encounter during the programs execution and which cannot really be recovered
             From,at which point,there is usually no other option than to terminate the programs execution.but before we do so,we can do
             some logic to carry out some steps before we explicitly shut down our app.

   **** Try-Catch Block   ****

          Potentially risky code can be enclosed inside a try block( that is code where an exception might be thrown ) and
           logic to handle the execution can be set in a Catch block right after it.
    1- Our program can run through to completion or we can terminate it gracefully on our own terms.
    2- So even if you have a multiple lines within your try block and not just two if an exception occurs during the execution,
       any lines occurring  after it will be ignored,and code execution moved over to the catch block.



   **** Finally  Block   ****

                Include a Finally block after the try-Catch block.A finally block is very often used in order to carry out some clean up operation
                after the code has run.for Example:- you could free up some resources which were being help by the program or maybe carry out some write operations before the program
                either moves along or terminates.Finally block runs will execute whether or not an exception is thrown.which is why it is defined at the end of a try catch block.
       1- One Feature of the finally block is that it can exist even without a catch.
       2- The Finally block is always executed when it is attached to a try and catch, and also a try without a catch.
       3- Primary purpose :-To write clean-up code which will always be executed regardless of whether an exception is thrown.


***************************************************************************************************************************************************************************

 1- One Feature when we have multiple catch block after a single try block is that the order of the catch blocks doesn't
    really matter.

    ********* Try With Resource Block   ***********

    Any class which implements the Java.lan.AutoClosable Interface can be used in the TryWithResourceBlock.This will allow java to auto close
    that resource once the try block or the associate catch block has been executed,whether there is an exception or not.
    1- To automatically close an object once the block has executed.

    ..............JAVA COLLECTIONS FRAMEWORKS........

    The Java collection frameworks refers to a set of Classes and interfaces that implement commonly reusable data structures.Although the collection framework is referred to as
    a framework,its actually a library.The Collection framework provide both interfaces that defines various collections.These interface represent different types of collections Such as List,Maps  and so on.
    And we have different classes implementing these interfaces.So you can choose the right collection to store your data based on your use case.

    ****** JAVA ARRAYS  *******

    Java Array are the first kind of collections that you encountered.They are not really part of java collection framework,but bcz arrays are basically a collection of Elements,its important
    that you understand and study the characteristics of arrays first before we move on java collections.
    An array can be a though of as a fixed length and fixed types of collection.Its a collection of objects where the type of the object or the type of the class that you are storing the array
    and the number of objects are specified up front.And once these specify,these cannot be MODIFIED after the array has been created.


    ******    List In JAVA   ************

        The Most widely used collection structure is the List.The List stores data in an ordered sequence,and the list allows you to store a duplicate
        values.The Java collections framework provides a number of different list implementations.


    ******    Sets and Maps In JAVA   ************

    Sets:- allow you to store values that are Unique in an Unordered Structure,and do not permit you to add elements that are duplicates of elements
           already present in the set.Perform a no. of different operations on sets, including Union,Intersection,Difference and subset operations.

    Maps:- Allow you to store data in the form of KEY VALUES pairs,thus enabling you to quickly loop up values associated with keys.

    1- So if you are going to be defining custom objects that have to be added to collection containers in the java framework,make sure that you override
       the .equals method from the base class as well as the Hash Code methods so that the object are compared correctly.
    2- Java Collections framework has a no.of different implementations of the SET Interface.All of these implementations also implement
       the Collection and iterable interfaces as well.
    3- There are other sets that implements these interface as well,Such as the LinkedHashSet.
    4- Ordering of Elements in " HASHSet" ,it returns in a random order.
    5- In LinkedHashSet the Elements are Accessible in the Insertion order.
    6- In TreeSet:- In the case of Integer set will return these elements to me in the ascending order by default.
    7- In TreeSet:- In the case of string this natural order is the Lexicographical or Alphabetical order.
